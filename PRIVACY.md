## Permissions Justification

The following is a list of permissions required by the extension along with justifications for each:

- **`tabs`**  
  *Purpose:* Allows the extension to interact with open browser tabs.  
  *Justification:* This permission is essential for retrieving information about open tabs, such as their titles, URLs, and active status, enabling users to manage them effectively. The Tab Manager Extension uses this permission to let users perform various actions, including closing, pinning, muting, automatically grouping, closing, or putting tabs to sleep based on user-defined rules. By leveraging this permission, the extension provides flexibility in managing tabs according to user preferences, helping to streamline the browsing experience and control memory usage.

- **`storage`**  
  *Purpose:* Allows the extension to store user preferences and settings locally.  
  *Justification:* The extension needs to save user preferences (e.g., grouping rules, auto-sleep and auto-close settings) to deliver a personalized experience. All preferences are stored locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy while retaining functionality tailored to the user's chosen tab management settings.

- **`activeTab`**  
  *Purpose:* Provides temporary access to the active tab when the extension is clicked.  
  *Justification:* This permission helps identify and highlight the currently active tab in the extension interface, allowing users to see which tab they’re managing. The active tab is also exempt from auto-close or auto-sleep actions, ensuring it remains open and accessible while in use. Additionally, the extension records the time the user last accessed a tab, so the auto-close and auto-sleep features can accurately track idle time, helping users manage tabs without unintentionally closing those recently used.

- **`tabGroups`**  
  *Purpose:* Enables the extension to create, manage, and manipulate tab groups within the browser.  
  *Justification:* This permission is necessary for organizing tabs into user-defined groups, such as pinned groups that act similarly to pinned tabs, providing easy access to essential tabs. Tab grouping is also crucial for the auto-grouping feature, which automatically categorizes tabs based on URL patterns or keywords specified by the user. This feature dynamically creates or removes tab groups to keep the browsing environment organized and responsive to the user’s needs.

### Host Permissions

- **`*://*/*`**  
  *Purpose:* Allows access to tab data across all websites.  
  *Justification:* The extension’s functionality is independent of specific sites; it is intended to organize tabs across any open website. No content is altered or accessed beyond identifying and managing tabs for the user's convenience.

## Data Security

Since no user data is transmitted outside the browser or stored in any external databases, there are no security risks related to data storage or external access. The extension only utilizes data needed for tab management, all of which remains within the browser's local environment.
